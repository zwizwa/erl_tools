%% FIXME: This needs review.  The basic idea is ok, but it still
%% doesn't handle structural changes.

%% Incremental UI rendering ala react can be implemented on top of the
%% memoizing evaluator by introducing a side effect and modifying the
%% meaning of change propagation.

%% Basically, an incremental evaluator is the same as a
%% non-incremental evaluator except for one change: "smart containers"
%% can either send incremantal updates via a side-channel, or
%% re-render and let their parent container go through a similar
%% decision process.

%% SUMMARY:
%% send the change through the side channel XOR propagate up.



%% I found it very surprising that this is simple to express with a
%% pruning memoizing evaluator.  It was completely non-trivial to
%% discover.  In fact the problem seemed "upside down": we DON'T just
%% propagate if there is change.

-module(react).
-export([test/1, update/5, compile/4]).


%% Split the idea into two parts:

%% UPDATE function.
%%
%% This knows about:
%% - the evaluation status of the arguments
%% - the (pure) constructor function
%% - the side channel for incremental updates


%% Eval:        The redo evaluator
%% SideChannel: Side channel receiving update commands
%% Cons:        The pure data constructor
%% OutVar:      Output var name
%% InVars:      Input var names

%% Some conventions:

%% - The pure data constructor gets {Var,Val} pairs where the Var are
%%   unique redo node names.  This makes it possible to attach names
%%   to subtrees for later side-channel updates.

%% The redo Eval is at the end here to allow for lambda-lifted
%% "reloadable closures".
update(SideChannel, Cons, OutVar, InVars, Eval) ->
    Map = redo:changed(Eval, InVars),
    ChangeList = maps:values(Map),
    false = lists:member(error, ChangeList),
    case lists:member(false, ChangeList) of
        false ->
            %% If they all changed, just re-render.  That also
            %% handles the initial rendering case.
            InVals = lists:zip(InVars,  redo:need_vals(Eval, InVars)),
            OutVal = Cons(InVals),
            redo:put_val(Eval, OutVar, OutVal),
            true;
        true ->
            %% If there is one that did not change, we know
            %% that there was no render before.
            lists:foreach(
              fun({_,false}) ->
                      %% Ignore the ones that did not change.
                      ok;
                 ({Var,true}) ->
                      %% Update the others in place.
                      [Val] = redo:need_vals(Eval, [Var]),
                      SideChannel({Var,Val})
              end,
              maps:to_list(Map)),
            %% And signal upstream that no more changes are
            %% necessary.
            false
    end.

%% COMPILE function

%% This maps {Cons,InVars} -> Outvar, against the Redo/SideChannel
%% context.  Here Cons is the pure function taking {Var,Val} pairs and
%% producting a Val, and InVars, OutVars are the variable names.

%% We use a function 

%% It would be nice to have an applicative description that can
%% construct a redo network from a series of function compostions.
%% That leaves everything parameterizeable. ( Using a data type does
%% not, for instance.  It would require a custom interpreter. )

%% Essentially we need to convert to ANF, creating an intermediate
%% node for each.

%% The update/1 functions that get produced are bound to SideChannel.
%% We need Redo (not Eval!) to create nodes.

%% This calls make_var twice.  Once to get the node name, and a second
%% time to install the function.,
