%% TODO:
%% - Allow on-demand with off state.

%% Given ssh access, this code takes care of:
%%
%% - read:  Event monitoring by watching the messages log
%% - exec:  Remote port program execution
%% - write: Binary code deployment, rsync
%%
%% Useful when it's not practically possible to run a remote Erlang
%% node.

%% EDIT: This is turning out to be quite useful, and compared to
%% previous convoluted approaches, it seems to abstract in the correct
%% way: keep it simple and just call 'ssh'.  Let any authentication be
%% handled in ssh config on a per host basis.  Any sharing can then
%% still be implemented at that config level.
