%% A mixin task queue for serializing operations.  This does not need
%% initialization.  It will use the key 'task_queue' in the State
%% dictionary.

%% About mixins: sometimes it is easier to just compose handler
%% functions that keep some state in the main process dictionary, as
%% opposed to using separate objects with message protocol and process
%% management.

%% Use the sequential nature of a server process to implement a
%% sequential task queue.  The operations themselves are performed in
%% an isolated process, wrapped in a catch-all error handler.

%% This was originally written to make bluepill:need/1 sequential, as
%% it is called in parallel from the parallel build system, which
%% creates a race condition.
