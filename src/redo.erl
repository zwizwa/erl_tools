%% TL;DR
%%
%% It is customary to apologize for writing yet another build system.
%% I've tried many existing approaches, and I've come to the
%% conclusion that for my case it was necessary.
%%
%% 1. Most build systems operates on files.  This is not abstract
%%    enough for me.  I need this generalized to updating abstract
%%    caches in a distributed heterogeneous network managed through
%%    Erlang proxy processes.
%%
%% 2. File names are not a good abstraction for quantification,
%%    i.e. to express generic build rules.  Erlang's pattern matching
%%    is a much better fit for this.
%%
%% 3. The system is built as an overlay, where a subset of the rules
%%    that operate only on files can be exported as Makefiles or
%%    (TODO) any other build system.


%% This is an Erlang implementation of a variant of djb's redo.
%% Inspired by apenwarr's blog posts.  It has been generalized a
%% number of times as new insights appeared.

%% Properties:
%%
%% - It is a reactive "pull" structure: a dependency graph is
%%   constructed as part of the first evaluation.
%%
%% - This is Functional Reactive Programming operating on abstract
%%   references, which allows embedding of abstract, imperative
%%   operations on an abstract store.  The system only provides
%%   synchronization.
%%
%% - Transaction interface: each "pull" conceptually corresponds to a
%%   single moment in time.
%%
%%

%% Additional remarks:
%%
%% - There is a "push" interface available once the network has
%%   executed once.
%%
%% - Rule quantification is implemented through Erlang pattern
%%   matching on var names.  Very convenient in practice.
%%
%% - Concrete opaque rules are supported to provide an "applicative"
%%   interface as an alternative to the "arrow" interface.


%% So what is the trick here?  What makes the redo approach different
%% from generic FRP?  Redo is aptly naed: it produces dependency
%% information as part of the first "do".
%%
%% This dependency structure is then updated on every product update.
%% This allows things like one dependency being a description of a
%% list of dependencies.  Or more succinctly: values can influence
%% dependency network struture structure.
%%
%% In addition, it is structured as a wrapper around an abstract
%% imperative update.  I.e. we do not deal with values directly inside
%% the Erlang code, we just provide an environment in which an
%% abstract imperative obdate is legal.


%% FIXME: Allow for a "window" timestamp to be included at startup.
%% E.g. don't take into account anything older than that.
%% Alternatively, save the timestamps somewhere, or derive them from
%% products.
%%
%% FIXME: Partial rebuilds don't work properly, e.g. if you have A->B
%% and you redo A, then B doesn't build when you redo B after.  It
%% seems that stamps would need to be stored associated to the rule,
%% not in general.
