Trying to find a unified way of looking at heterogeneous dataflow
networks comprising many different machines and platforms.

Unifying principles:

- epid: extension of Erlang Pid for leaf node access, uni-directional
  message passing.

- epid_app: applicative composition mechanism built on epid

- top level specification built on epid_app

  exo_patch process = {epid_app, start_link, [#{}]};

  do_patch.erl connected to redo
